# Digital Image Processing Lab

This repository contains all the tasks and experiments performed for the **Digital Image Processing (DIP) Lab**. Each task demonstrates different image processing techniques, ranging from basic image operations to advanced filtering, segmentation, and compression.

## **Contents of the Repository**

- **Task 1:** Reading, displaying, and exploring colored images using OpenCV and Matplotlib.  
- **Task 2:** Color channel separation (R, G, B) and grayscale conversion.  
- **Task 3:** Histogram equalization (both built-in and manual) and contrast enhancement techniques.  
- **Task 4:** Spatial filtering techniques: mean filter, median filter, mode filter, and Gaussian blur.  
- **Task 5:** Motion blur restoration using unsharp masking, deconvolution, bilateral filtering, adaptive sharpening, and frequency domain methods.  
- **Task 6:** Color space conversions (RGB, HSV, YCbCr, Lab), white balancing, and color-based segmentation.  
- **Task 7:** Thresholding and segmentation in RGB, HSV, and YCbCr spaces.  
- **Task 8:** Huffman encoding, JPEG-like compression, PSNR, MSE, compression ratio, and rate-distortion calculations.  
- **Task 9:** Morphological image processing: erosion, dilation, opening, closing, boundary extraction, hole filling, noise removal, and shape detection.  
- **Task 10:** Image binarization techniques: global, local, adaptive thresholding, and segmentation using K-means and Mean Shift clustering.

## **Conclusion**

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive study of various image processing techniques. Each task focuses on key concepts such as:

- **Image enhancement** (contrast, histogram equalization, filtering)
- **Color space manipulation and segmentation**
- **Image restoration and sharpening**
- **Image compression and coding**
- **Morphological operations and object detection**
- **Thresholding and clustering-based segmentation**

Through these tasks, fundamental skills in **digital image analysis, processing, and visualization** have been developed, providing a strong foundation for advanced applications in computer vision and image processing.
